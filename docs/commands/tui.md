# `stado` (TUI)

The primary surface. Launching `stado` with no subcommand opens the
TUI inside the current repo.

## What it does

Boot sequence:

1. Load config (koanf: `config.toml` + `STADO_*` env + defaults).
2. Resolve the provider — explicit `[defaults].provider` if set,
   otherwise start an async probe for bundled local runners
   (ollama / llamacpp / vllm / lmstudio) + user presets, picking the
   first reachable one. If the probe is still running when you hit
   `Enter` on the first prompt, the prompt queues and auto-replays when
   the probe resolves instead of freezing the UI on a duplicate probe.
3. Open or create a session for this cwd (sidecar bare repo at
   `$XDG_DATA_HOME/stado/sessions/<repo-id>.git`).
4. Walk cwd upward for `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` → injected as the
   system prompt on every turn.
5. Load `.stado/skills/*.md` → available as `/skill:<name>`.
6. Load the bundled `auto-compact` background plugin, then any extra
   installed plugins from `[plugins].background`.
7. Start the bubbletea event loop.

Shutdown: `Ctrl+D` or `/exit`.

## Why it exists

Interactive coding sessions benefit from:

- Visible conversation history with distinct user / assistant /
  thinking / tool blocks.
- Live-streaming assistant text with an elapsed counter during
  long thinking.
- Explicit plugin approval cards for plugins that declare
  `ui:approval`.
- Mid-stream slash commands (`/clear`, `/compact`, `/retry`).
- Context-window visibility (soft/hard thresholds, cost, cache ratio).
- Automatic hard-threshold recovery through the bundled `auto-compact`
  background plugin.
- In-process session switching and fresh-session creation.
- A sidebar pinning session label, cwd, model, instructions, skills.

Everything the TUI does is backed by `internal/runtime`'s core agent
loop, so `stado run` / `stado acp` / `stado headless` produce
bit-identical conversations from the same input.

## Launching

```sh
stado                     # TUI in current dir
stado session resume abc  # TUI rooted in a past session's worktree
```

`stado session resume` changes into the session's worktree before
booting so replay of `.stado/conversation.jsonl` picks up where you
left off.

### Tracing startup / first-turn issues

For focused TUI diagnostics:

```sh
STADO_TUI_TRACE=1 stado
```

This enables a narrow trace log for the startup probe and first-turn
path. The sidebar `Logs` section will show events like provider probe
start/finish, prompt queueing behind the probe, provider resolution,
and stream start/first-event timing.

If `[otel].enabled = true`, the TUI also exports real OTel spans for the
session boot path, including the TUI run span and the startup local-
provider probe span. The sidebar trace mode is additive; it is for
human debugging, not a replacement for OTLP export.

## Theme and templates

- Bundled themes: `stado-dark`, `stado-light`, and `stado-contrast`.
- `/theme` or `Ctrl+X T` opens the theme picker. `/theme <id>` switches
  directly.
- Theme overrides live at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/stado/theme.toml`.
  Selecting a bundled theme writes that file so the choice persists.
- Template overrides live at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/stado/templates/*.tmpl`.
- Missing template files fall back to the bundled defaults, so you can
  override a single widget without copying the entire template set.

```

- **Chat viewport** — all conversation blocks. Scroll with PageUp
  / PageDown. GotoBottom on every new block.
- **Input box** — bubbles textarea. Grows with newlines (Shift+Enter).
- **Status bar** — compact cwd, branch, version, streaming state,
  elapsed-during-stream pill, tokens / context %, cost, keybind hint.
- **Sidebar** — pinned metadata. Toggle with `Ctrl+T` or `/sidebar`.
  Debug diagnostics and the info log tail are hidden by default; use
  `/debug` to expand them when investigating runtime/provider issues.

### Split view

`/split` divides the chat viewport into two panes:

- **Top** — activity tail: `tool` + `system` blocks.
- **Bottom** — conversation: `user` + `assistant` + `thinking`.

Useful in heavy tool-use sessions where operational noise was
drowning the conversation.

## Keybinds

Full list lives in the `?` help overlay. The ones most worth
memorising:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Submit the current input |
| `Shift+Enter` | Newline in input (multi-line prompt) |
| `@` | Open inline agent/session/skill/file completion |
| `Tab` | Toggle Plan / Do mode |
| `Ctrl+P` | Open command palette |
| `/` | Open inline slash-command suggestions above the input |
| `Ctrl+X A` | Open agent picker |
| `Ctrl+X M` | Open model picker |
| `Ctrl+X L` | Open session manager |
| `Ctrl+X N` | Create and switch to a fresh session |
| `Ctrl+X T` | Open theme picker |
| `Ctrl+X S` | Open status modal |
| `Ctrl+X H` | Cycle thinking display: show, tail, hide |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Ctrl+X Ctrl+B` | Toggle BTW mode |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel stream / clear pending queue |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit stado |
| `?` | Help overlay (keybinds + slash commands) |
| `Up` / `Down` | Prev/next in input history |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Scroll chat viewport |
| `Ctrl+G` / `Home` | Scroll to top |
| `Ctrl+Alt+G` / `End` | Scroll to bottom |

### Plan, Do, and BTW mode

`Tab` toggles between the main two modes:

- **Do** (default) — all configured tools visible to the model.
- **Plan** — only non-mutating tools (`read`, `grep`, LSP lookup,
  …). Mutating (`write`, `edit`) and exec (`bash`) are filtered
  from the `TurnRequest.Tools`. The model naturally shifts to
  producing a plan / outline rather than executing.

The input rail changes colour by mode so Do, Plan, and BTW are visible
without reading the inline status row.

`Ctrl+X A` or `/agents` opens a picker for all three agents. `Tab`
still toggles the common Do/Plan path, and `/btw` or `Ctrl+X Ctrl+B`
still toggles **BTW** mode for off-band side questions. BTW replies
render in their own block and do not append to the main conversation
history.

The active agent shows in the input box's inline status row and in the
sidebar Agent section once the chat view is active.

Typing `@` in the message editor opens inline completion. Agent rows
come first; accepting Do, Plan, or BTW switches the active agent and
removes the mention from the draft. Session rows come next; accepting a
session-only mention switches to that session, while accepting a session
inside a longer prompt inserts `session:<id>`. Skill rows inject the
selected skill body into the conversation and remove the mention from
the draft. File rows still insert the selected repo-relative path into
the prompt.

Completed assistant responses include a compact muted footer with the
agent, model/provider, elapsed time, tool count, token delta, and cost
delta for that turn when the provider reports usage.

Thinking blocks are display-controlled, not capture-controlled:
`Ctrl+X H` cycles full thinking, recent-tail-only thinking, and hidden
thinking. `/thinking show`, `/thinking tail`, and `/thinking hide` set a
specific mode. The toggle only affects the TUI viewport; provider-native
thinking blocks are still preserved in the session transcript.

## Slash commands

See [features/slash-commands.md](../features/slash-commands.md) for
the full list. `/` opens inline fuzzy suggestions above the input;
`Ctrl+P` opens the full modal command palette. Quick reference:

- `/help` — overlay with every keybind + slash command
- `/clear` — wipe conversation; cancels any in-flight stream
- `/compact` — summarise and replace conversation (y/n confirm)
- `/retry` — regenerate the last assistant turn
- `/model` — model picker (`Ctrl+X M`); marks the current model and
  surfaces favorites/recents first. Press `Ctrl+F` in the picker to
  toggle a favorite. Selecting a model saves it as the new default.
- `/agents` — agent picker for Do, Plan, and BTW
- `/theme` — theme picker; bundled choices are `stado-dark`,
  `stado-light`, and `stado-contrast`
- `/status` — modal summary of provider, model, tools, plugins, MCP,
  LSP readiness, OTel, sandbox, and context
- `/thinking` — cycle thinking display; `/thinking show|tail|hide`
- `/switch` — searchable session manager
- `/new` — create and switch to a fresh session
- `/sessions` — textual session overview
- `/debug` — toggle sidebar diagnostics/log tail
- `/context` — session state (tokens, cost, budget, instructions, skills)
- `/btw` — off-band side-question mode

## Multi-session Overlay

`Ctrl+X L` or `/switch` opens the searchable session overlay. The
overlay owns its own keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Switch/resume the highlighted session |
| `Ctrl+N` | Create and switch to a fresh session |
| `Ctrl+R` | Rename the highlighted session |
| `Ctrl+F` | Fork the highlighted session and switch to the child |
| `Ctrl+D` | Confirmed delete of the highlighted inactive session |
| `Esc` | Close or cancel the current overlay action |

Deleting the active session is blocked. Switch, new, and fork keep the
existing safety gate: submit or clear drafts, queued prompts, approval
cards, compaction prompts, streams, and running tools first.

## Approvals

Native bundled tools no longer pause on the old TUI approval loop.
Control the native surface by narrowing `[tools].enabled` or
`[tools].disabled`.

Plugins can still ask for explicit user approval by declaring the
`ui:approval` capability and calling the approval host import. Those
requests render as a focused approval card with Allow/Deny actions while
the text input remains editable. The old `/approvals` slash command is
kept as a compatibility hint and explains this migration path.

## Config

`stado config show` prints the resolved effective config. The TUI-
relevant sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `[defaults]` | provider + model pins |
| `[tools]` | trim the bundled tool set |
| `[context]` | soft / hard thresholds on context-window usage |
| `[budget]` | warn + hard cap on cumulative cost |
| `[hooks]` | `post_turn` lifecycle shell hook |
| `[plugins]` | extra background plugin IDs, CRL, Rekor URL |
| `[mcp.servers.<name>]` | external MCP tool servers |

## Gotchas

- **The cwd matters.** The TUI opens a session for whichever repo
  owns the current directory. `cd` first, then launch.
- **AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md is cwd-walk upwards.** Nearest wins;
  you can put one in a subdirectory for per-module instructions
  in a monorepo.
- **Slash commands during streaming route immediately** (since the
  queue-during-stream fix). Regular text prompts queue until the
  current turn drains.
- **The input starts taller than one line** so short multi-line prompts
  are visible without immediate growth. It still horizontally scrolls
  on long single lines; use `Shift+Enter` for explicit newlines.
- **Landing view** — empty sessions start with the stado ANSI logo,
  centered input, command hints, cwd, and version. Once the first block
  arrives, the normal chat layout takes over.
